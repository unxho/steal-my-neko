## About
Awesome Telegram parser & poster configured to steal nekos.  
Script uses web and telegram parsers. Telegram parser requires user account to receive and use file_id directly.
Telegram parser supports ad block which automatically detects ad links and mentions. Unfortunately, ad blocking also blocks any album for now.

Started in June 2021
